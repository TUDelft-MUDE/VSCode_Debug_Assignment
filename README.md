# Programming assignment 1.4 Commit to clean data

You can preview this assignment on https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/workbook-2025/assignments/PA1.4/README.html. You can obtain your personal repository for submission on: https://classroom.github.com/a/BfzvPQKp

Before you can start this assignment, read the theory pages in the book: https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/programming/week_1_4.html ([Version control](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/_git/github.com_TeachBooks_learn-programming/mude-2025/book/version_control/version_control.html) and [Jupyter Notebooks and git](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/_git/github.com_TeachBooks_learn-programming/mude-2025/book/version_control/notebooks.html))

In this assignment you'll make exercises on:
1. [Install GitHub Desktop](./1_install_github_desktop.md)
2. [Make commit locally](./2_commit_local.md)
3. [Make commit on GitHub online](./3_commit_online.md)
4. [Fetch and pull from the remote repository](./4_fetch_pull.md)
5. [Install git](./5_install_git.md)
6. [Data cleaning](./6_data_cleaning.ipynb)
7. [Data import](./7_data_import.ipynb)

You'll need to have done this to be able to make the workshop and group assignment.

You pass this PA if you:
- edited multiple files in a single commit in exercise 2
- replaced the markdown line in exercise 3
- Cleaned the data properly in exercise 6

For the fundamental programming concepts you'll work on [functions and matplotlib](./8_programming_fundamental_concepts.ipynb)

These exercises on fundamental programming concepts are not obligatory. If you struggle with one of the topics from the programming fundamentals, you're strongly advised to go through the linked reference materials by yourself ([functions](https://oit.tudelft.nl/learn-python/2025/basics/functions.html) and [matplotlib](https://oit.tudelft.nl/learn-python/2025/matplotlib/intro.html)). During the programming tutorial on Tuesday these steps will be demonstrated too.
