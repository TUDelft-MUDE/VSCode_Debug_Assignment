# Fetch and pull

You've now made changes to your repository both locally and remote. However, the remote changes are not yet on your computer. Let's fetch and pull them!

## Task 4.1 Fetch and pull

In GitHub Desktop, click 'Fetch origin' in the taskbar (where you previously click 'push origin'). After fetching, the button should change to 'Pull origin' with a 1, representing the commit you did online. Click again on the button to pull the changes to your computer.

## Task 4.2 Check changes

Open [the file `3_commit_online.md`](./3_commit_online.md) to check whether the changes have come through.
