# Make commit online

This page will show you how to make commits to the remote repository on GitHub directly from the web browser. If you only have small changes to make to a small number of files, this can be faster than doing it with your local repository.

## Task 3.1 Edit this file

To edit this file via the web browser you need to locate it on GitHub on your personal repository you created via the GitHub classroom link. First click on the file in the GitHub repository, then the pencil icon. Replace the comment below with your own content

% REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MARKDOWN CONTENT

## Task 3.2 Commit your change

Click on the green button 'Commit changes' which ask you for a commit message. The commit message can be useful for reviewing changes, however, especially when working with multiple people. It could be useful to write your commit message such that it completes the following sentence: _This commit will..._.

Once you have made the commit, you should see the rendered version of this page with your changes.
