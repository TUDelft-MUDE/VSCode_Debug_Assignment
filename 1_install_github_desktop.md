# Install GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a nice piece of software which has a fluent visual approach and hides some of the nasty git stuff. Although you'll need to dive into the CLI of git from time-to-time, most of the workflow can be performed in the GUI.

## Task 1.1 Install GitHub Desktop

Download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/download/

## TAsk 1.2 Sign in with your GitHub account

Sign in using the GitHub account you created before. You'll be prompted with the option to define your name and email for commits, using your GitHub account name and email address is fine.
